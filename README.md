# Weather
This Goal of this application is to predict short term temperature(3 hours) in Atlanta. 
I have extracted hourly weather data from Atlanta from 2012-2016. This weather data includes
wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity and pressure.

Model Complexity: The VAR model may be too simplistic if your data is highly non-linear or has strong periodic components. Consider models that can capture these, such as SARIMAX with seasonal orders, or machine learning models that can learn complex patterns.
Parameter Tuning: Ensure that the parameters for the VAR model are optimally chosen. This can involve selecting the correct lag order or testing different configurations.
Data Preprocessing: It might help to preprocess your data by detrending or deseasonalizing it before fitting the VAR model if your data has strong trends or seasonal effects.
Exogenous Variables: If there are external factors influencing temperature changes that are not included in your model, consider adding these as exogenous variables.
Evaluation Metrics: In addition to visual comparison, use statistical metrics to quantify the accuracy of your forecasts, such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
Error Analysis: Look into the periods where the forecast deviates significantly from the actuals to understand why. This could give insights into what aspects of the data the model is not capturing.
Model Diagnostics: Perform diagnostic checks on the residuals of your VAR model to ensure they are white noise. If not, this indicates that the model can be further improved.
Ensemble Models: Sometimes using a combination of models (ensemble methods) can yield better results than any single model, as different models might capture different aspects of the data.
Frequency of Data: Ensure that the forecast frequency matches the frequency of the actual data. The plot suggests that the forecast might be at a different frequency (daily averages instead of hourly, perhaps).
Lastly, ensure that you are plotting the forecast against the correct portion of the actual data. The forecast should align with the test data that was set aside and not seen by the model during training. If your forecast is for future periods beyond the range of your historical data, it would not be appropriate to compare it to past actuals.

To delve deeper, you might want to share more details about how you prepared your data, the specifics of the model fitting, or the post-forecasting steps. With more information, I can provide more tailored guidance.
